# Instagram Clone


Repository intended to simulate the **Instagram** system, including the backend on nodeJS, a front-end application, and a mobile version.

## Step by step

First you need to clone the repository to your local machine.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/alanrslima/instagram_clone.git && cd instagram_clone
```

### Using backend

Access the backend folder
```
$ cd backend
```

First make sure you have a package manager for the JavaScript language ([npm](https://www.npmjs.com) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/pt-BR/)) and then install the project dependency packages with one of the commands below:
```
$ yarn
```
```
$ npm install
```
To proceed you need to have the [nodeJs](https://nodejs.org/en/) on your machine. CMake sure of this and start the server in development mode with one of the commands below:
```
$ yarn dev
```
```
$ npm run dev
```

If everything happens correctly, the server will be running and ready for use on port **3333**.
